# About Me🧙‍♂️:
Welcome to my profile, I don't have much to show right now, as im getting my programming skills up and running, but I can tell you some things about me. 

I am from Argentina, but I'm living in Ecuador and I'm 19 years old. I get frustrated when I see bugs or a myriad of problems in code, I still don't have the skills to solve them on other people's projects, but I assure you, I'm going to make a good bug report.


I am fluent on both Spanish and English (no certification yet, but hey, who wrote this?)

I also enjoy using Linux (Arch Linux FTW!), it's just a better way to use a computer, especially in cases where you lack computing power (like mine).

Currently searching for a programming language I enjoy using, so I can deepen my skils without being stuck in a language that doesn't suit me. I take recommendations.
I am looking to be employed, if you like what you see, please contact me.

This always happens, you think everything is ready and the most unexpected thing blows up in your face...

Expect the unexpected.
