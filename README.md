# About Meüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:
Welcome to my profile, I don't have much to show right now, as im getting my programming skills up and running, but I can tell you some things about me. 

I am from Argentina, but I'm living in Ecuador and I'm 20 years old. I get frustrated when I see bugs or a myriad of problems in code, I am training the skills to solve them on other people's projects, but I assure you, I'm going to make a good bug report and if i annoy you about it i will be polite.


I am fluent on both Spanish and English (no certification yet, but hey, who wrote this?)

I also enjoy using Linux, it's just a better way to use a computer, especially in cases where you lack computing power (like mine).

I am looking to be employed, if you like what you see, please contact me.

This always happens, you think everything is ready and the most unexpected thing blows up in your face...

Expect the unexpected.
